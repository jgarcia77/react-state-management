# State Management in React
> This repository explores state management in React using different approaches.
Switch to any implementation branch to see full implementation of each respective state management approach.
All instructional branches are based off of the **useState-implementation** branch and contain a 
**README** with refactoring instructions.  The main branch contains a boilerplate application with no state management so feel free to implement your own approach.
